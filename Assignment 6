(ii) {"Hello",3,True}
(iii) ("Sun","Moon")

Q.8. Explain the mutable and immutable data types with proper explanation & examples.
Ans: Immutable data types are those which can't be modified. On trying to modify or reassign, new reference gets created.
Eg. Int, float, tuple etc.
Mutable data types are those which can be modified and on modification, it does not create any new instance but directly impacts the object itself. Eg. List, Dictionary, set etc.

Q.9. Write a code to create the given structure using only for loop.
*

Ans:
rows = int(input())
for i in range(rows):
    for j in range(rows - i - 1):
        print(" ", end="")
    
    for k in range(2*i + 1):
        print("*", end="")
    
    print()

Q.10. Write a code to create the given structure using while loop.

Ans:
rows = int(input())
end = rows + (rows-1)
for i in range(1,rows+1):
  count = 1
  for j in range(1,rows+1):
     if j<i:
        print(" ")
     elif j>=i:
        print("|")
        count+=1
        
  print()
  end-=2
