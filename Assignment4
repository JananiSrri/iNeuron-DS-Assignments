1. What exactly is []?
Ans: [] is an empty list.

2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value &#39;hello&#39; as the
third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)
Let&#39;s pretend the spam includes the list [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;] for the next three queries.
Ans: spam[2] = 'hello'

3. What is the value of spam[int(int(&#39;3&#39; * 2) / 11)]?
Ans: 'd'

4. What is the value of spam[-1]?
Ans: 'd'

5. What is the value of spam[:2]?
Let&#39;s pretend bacon has the list [3.14, &#39;cat,&#39; 11, &#39;cat,&#39; True] for the next three questions.
Ans: ['a','b']

6. What is the value of bacon.index(&#39;cat&#39;)?
Ans: 1

7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?
Ans: [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat' True, 99]

8. How does bacon.remove(&#39;cat&#39;) change the look of the list in bacon?
Ans: [3.14, 11, 'cat' True, 99]

9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?
Ans: The list concatination operator is '+'. This concatenates the two or more lists. For example,
[1,2,3]+[4,5] => [1,2,3,4,5]
The list replecation operator is '*'. This multiplies the the list into the number of given times. For example,
[1,2,3]*3 => [1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3]

10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?
Ans: .append() method add the given element to the last index of the list whereas .insert() method inserts the value in the given index of the list.

11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?
Ans: .remove() => This method removes the given element in the argument from the list.
.pop() => This method removes the value in the last index of a list.

12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.
Ans: i)They both can be accessed using index.
ii) They both can be iterated in the same way.
iii) They both are sequenced and has length.

13. What&#39;s the difference between tuples and lists?
Ans: Tuples enclosed within () are immutable and lists enclosed within [] are mutable.

14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?
Ans: (42)

15. How do you get a list value&#39;s tuple form? How do you get a tuple value&#39;s list form?
Ans: type() method can help us to do that.

16. Variables that &quot;contain&quot; list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they
contain?
Ans: They contain references of the list values.
17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
Ans:  copy.copy()
This copies the reference of the original object and therefore, any change in the original object can reflect in the copied object as well.
copy.deepcopy()
This method creates a new reference and assigns the value of orginal refercence to this new reference. Therefore, both the references becomes independent of each other and
modifying one does not affect the other.
