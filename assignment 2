1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
Ans: The 2 different values of Bool data type is here, True or False. 
     We write them like, isAlphabet = True etc.

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
Ans: The three types of boolean operators are i) Logical AND(and), ii) Logical OR(or) iii) Logical NOT(not)

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator&#39;s truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
Ans: Logical Operations:
Logical AND:
Operand1        Operand2        Result
True             True            True
True             False           False
False            True            False
False            False           False

Logical OR:
Operand1        Operand2        Result
True             True            True
True             False           True
False            True            True
False            False           False

Logical NOT:
Operand1        Result
True             False           
False            True

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 &gt; 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 &gt; 4)
(5 &gt; 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 &gt; 4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)
Ans: False, False, True, False, False, True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
Ans: <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=
6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.
Ans:Equal to(==) operator is used in logical comparison and returns a boolean value always. Whereas, assignment(=) operator is used to assign a value/experession to a variable. 
Eg.,
a = 5 #assignment
b = 6 #assignment
a == b #equal to returning False

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print(&#39;eggs&#39;)
if spam &gt; 5:
print(&#39;bacon&#39;)
else:
print(&#39;ham&#39;)
print(&#39;spam&#39;)
print(&#39;spam&#39;)
Ans: Excecution of the code will return "hamspamspam" and the blocks here are if continued with another if and then else.

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
Ans: The code is here:
if spam == 1:
  print("Hello")
elif spam == 2:
  print("Howdy")
else:
  print("Greetings!")
  
9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
Ans: Cntrl+C

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Ans: Break terminates the loop which is running and continue statement passes the particular iteration to the next iteration.

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
Ans: All are same and all of them return same list of range values.

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
Ans: For Loop:
for i in range(1,11):
  print(i)
While Loop:
i=1
while(i<=10):
  print(i)
  i+=1
  
13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam?
Ans:spam.bacon()
