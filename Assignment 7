Q.1. Create two int type variables, apply addition, subtraction, division and multiplications
and store the results in variables. Then print the data in the following format by calling the
variables:
First variable is __ & second variable is __.
Addition: __ + __ = __
Subtraction: __ - __ = __
Multiplication: __ * __ = __
Division: __ / __ = __
Ans: 
firstVar = int(input())
secondVar = int(input())
add = firstVar+secondVar
sub = abs(firstVar-secondVar)
mul = firstVar*secondVar
div = firstVar//secondVar

print('First variable is {0} & second variable is {1}.'.format(firstVar, secondVar))
print('Addition: {0} + {1} = {2}'.format(firstVar, secondVar))
print('Subraction: {0} + {1} = {2}'.format(firstVar, secondVar))
print('Multiplication: {0} + {1} = {2}'.format(firstVar, secondVar))
print('Division: {0} + {1} = {2}'.format(firstVar, secondVar))

Q.2. What is the difference between the following operators:
(i) ‘/’ & ‘//’
(ii) ‘**’ & ‘^’
Ans:
i) / : The '/' operator performs regular division and returns the result as a floating-point number (float) or a decimal. Eg: 7/2 = 3.5
// : The '//' operator performs floor division, also known as integer division. It returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result of the division. Eg.: 7//2 = 3 
ii) ** : Exponential operator for example: 2**3 = 8 => 2*2*2
^ : The '^' operator is not used for exponentiation in Python. 10 ^ 6 will return 12, as the binary representation of 10 is 1010 and the binary representation of 6 is 0110. Performing bitwise XOR between them gives 1100, which is 12 in decimal.

Q.3. List the logical operators.
Ans: and, or and not operator are the logical operators in python.

Q.4. Explain right shift operator and left shift operator with examples.
Ans:
 The right shift operator (>>) shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions.
Each shift to the right effectively divides the number by 2 (integer division), discarding the rightmost bits and adding zeroes from the left.
Example: x >> y shifts the bits of x to the right by y positions.
 The left shift operator (<<) shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions.
Each shift to the left effectively multiplies the number by 2, adding zeroes on the right.
Example: x << y shifts the bits of x to the left by y positions.

Q.5. Create a list containing int type data of length 15. Then write a code to check if 10 is
present in the list or not.
Ans:
arr = []
for i in range(15):
    num = int(input())
    arr.append(num)
if 10 in arr:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
